## Folder Basic
This simple program has no facilaties for anything but cyphering.  It will encrypt and decrypt, but the program is not useful.

To run, a key has been generated using one of the other more complex versions.  It also runs using an identical stream of numbers each time.  This version merely shows the layering.

Running the program with "source" encrypts to "target".  Running it again with "target" as the source produces a new target the same as the original source.  There are no checks to insure correct operation.
